Introduction
============

The purpose of this project was to TDD the building of a clone of AirBnB using Ruby.

This was a group project for week six of Makers Academy.

The learning intentions for this project was to build tested, easy to change software in a team. This was our first group project and we focussed on following agile software development methods such as working in two day sprints and using XP values.

We used a Trello board to keep track of sprint tickets and for making notes on our daily stand-ups and retros.
